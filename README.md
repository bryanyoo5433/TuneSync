# TuneSync

This project, built during BoilerMake XII, is a web application that helps musicians analyze and refine their phrasing, timing, and expression using waveform visualization and AI-driven feedback.

## Features 🚀 
- YouTube-to-Waveform Conversion – Extracts and visualizes waveforms from YouTube audio clips.
- Real-Time Recording & Waveform Generation – Users can record their playing and compare it visually.
- AI-Powered Phrasing Feedback – Uses Google Gemini AI to compare recordings and provide timing, rhythm, and expression insights with improvement suggestions.
- Waveform Alignment – Automatically synchronizes recordings for accurate side-by-side comparisons.
- Interactive Moving Cursor – Tracks playback across the waveform to help users visualize phrasing dynamics.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
Frontend: React, Web Audio API

Backend: Flask, Express.js

AI & Processing: Google Gemini AI (GenAI), YouTube audio extraction, waveform analysis

🖥️ How It Works
1. Upload a YouTube link or record your own playing 🎼
2. The app extracts and visualizes the waveform 📊
3. Google Gemini AI analyzes phrasing, timing, and expression 🤖
4. Users receive AI-generated improvement suggestions 🎶
